## Installation

You can install the -development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("romainfrancois/dice")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(dice)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

gf <- iris %>% group_by(Species)

# 3 slices of Sepal.Length following the groups of gf
chop(gf, gf$Sepal.Length)

# dice() to lazily get chop()ed columns
e <- dice(gf)
e$Sepal.Length

# Use the callback= to act when a column is chop()ed
e <- dice(gf, callback = print)

# A list is being printed when the chop()ing happens
chunks <- e$Sepal.Length

# but then not anymore as it has now been resolved already
e$Sepal.Length
```
